# Coalition Game

### Sharply Value: Rationale

**Consider the marginal contribution of player***i* **for all possible coalition** *S âŠ‚ N \ {i}*  
  * There are |*S*|! permutations in which all members in *S* precede *i*
  * There are (*n* - |*S*| - 1)! permutations in which all members not in *S* follow *i*  
  * *i* has the same marginal contribution in these permutations
